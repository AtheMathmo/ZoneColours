/* Zone Color Changer is a mod for Cities Skylines. 
 * 
 * Provides an option to change the colors of the rico zones.
 * With color issues some of the zoning colors might not be clearly 
 * visible or one does simply not like the color. 
 * 
 * This is a continuation of the Zone Colours mod by AtheMathmo.
 * In the original mod color pickers are attached to the zoning panel
 * and had alignment/wrapping issues, the colorfield always expanded
 * out of screen, I was not able to solve this issue. Even if it would be solved
 * more problem could come with ui resolution mods when hooking the zoning panel.
 * In the original mod, he color profile is only saved at OnLevelUnload. 
 * Instant return to desktop or a crash leads to lost color profile.
 * 
 * Because of lacking programming skills I took the easiest solution.
 * The mod now has a free floating UI Panel (which btw solves the random exception
 * issue where the mod tried to access the zoning panel before it is unlocked)
 * which can be toggled by a Keybind (set in mod option panel, default is Ctrl+K).
 * 
 * The UI has 6 color fields, on for every zone in the game's order.
 * 3 Buttons for save, load and reset. Save saves the current set color
 * profile in the "zone-color-changer.cfg" file, localappdata/ModConfig.
 * Load loads the profile from this file, reset resets the profile to 
 * the game default colors (but does not save it to the file).
 * 
 * Things could made much better in here, but the mod is functional.
 * The color of the zoning icon in the zoning panel does not change,
 * this would be a cool feature. Also it would be nice to have the color pickers
 * back in the zoning panel and icons for the buttons.
 * 
 * Contributions and suggestions welcome.
 *
